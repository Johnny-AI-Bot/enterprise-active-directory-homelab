Security groups were created in Active Directory to represent role-based access
within the domain environment.

Permissions were assigned to groups rather than individual users to enforce
least-privilege access principles. Test user accounts were used to validate that
users only had access to resources required for their assigned role.

This demonstrates foundational identity and access management (IAM) concepts
used in enterprise Windows environments.
