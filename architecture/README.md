This lab is designed to simulate a small enterprise Windows domain environment.

The architecture consists of a Windows Server acting as a Domain Controller,
one or more Windows 11 client systems joined to the domain, and an isolated
virtual network to prevent external exposure.

Virtual machines are hosted using VMware, allowing controlled testing of
identity management, authentication, access control, and basic network
traffic behavior in a safe environment.
