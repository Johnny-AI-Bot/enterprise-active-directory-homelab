A Windows 11 client system was deployed and configured to join the Active
Directory domain.

The system was connected to the isolated virtual network and successfully
authenticated against the Domain Controller. Domain membership was verified
using Active Directory Users and Computers.

Joining the client to the domain enables centralized authentication, policy
enforcement, and access control, simulating how endpoint systems are managed in
a real enterprise environment.
