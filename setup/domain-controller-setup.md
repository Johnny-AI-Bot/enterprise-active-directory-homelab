This lab was initialized by deploying a Windows Server instance and configuring
it as a Domain Controller.

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) was installed and a new forest and
domain were created to simulate a small enterprise environment. DNS services
were configured as part of the domain setup to support authentication and name
resolution.

The Domain Controller serves as the centralized identity authority for the lab,
providing user authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement for
domain-joined systems.
