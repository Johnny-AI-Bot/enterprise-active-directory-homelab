Wireshark was used in the isolated lab network to observe Windows domain-related
traffic during common authentication activity.

Traffic patterns were reviewed during domain join and user logon to better
understand how domain authentication and basic host communication appear at the
network level.

This reinforced foundational network visibility and troubleshooting skills while
keeping the environment isolated and safe for testing.
